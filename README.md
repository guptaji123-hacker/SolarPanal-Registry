# SolarPanel Registry

## Project Description

SolarPanel Registry is a comprehensive blockchain-based platform designed to track and manage solar panel installations and their energy production. This smart contract system provides a transparent, immutable registry for solar panel owners to record their installations, monitor energy generation, and maintain accurate records of their renewable energy contributions. The platform serves as a decentralized database that can be used for regulatory compliance, incentive programs, and energy trading verification.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a unified, transparent ecosystem for solar energy tracking that empowers homeowners, businesses, and governments to accurately monitor renewable energy production. By leveraging blockchain technology, we aim to build trust in green energy initiatives, facilitate peer-to-peer energy trading, and support the global transition to sustainable energy sources. The SolarPanel Registry will serve as the foundation for a more connected and accountable renewable energy infrastructure.
